  <p>Christianity - as the world knows it - is not the faith of the Messiah. It is a <strong>Roman counterfeit</strong>, manufactured over centuries to replace the true Covenant of Yahuah with a system of control, deception, and idolatry. The religion that claims to follow the “Son of God” actually <strong>rejects His Name, His teachings, and His appointed times</strong>.</p>

  <p>Let’s get straight to it. The name <strong>“Jesus”</strong> never existed in the original Scriptures. The letter <strong>J</strong> didn’t even exist in any language until the 16th century. The real Name of the Savior is <strong>Yahusha</strong> – meaning “Yahuah saves.” The Name given by Heaven was <strong>replaced</strong> by a Roman fabrication to align with the pantheon of Greek gods, ultimately forming the image of a sun-deity disguised as a lamb.</p>

  <p>The Roman church - and later her Protestant daughters - taught believers to reject the Torah (Yahuah’s instructions), to desecrate His true Sabbath, and to celebrate <strong>pagan holidays</strong> like Christmas (Saturnalia), Easter (Ishtar), and Sunday worship (Sol Invictus). These are not harmless traditions - they are ancient Babylonian customs rebranded with a “Christian” label.</p>

  <p>The Messiah never came to start a new religion. He came to <strong>restore the Covenant</strong> and call back the lost sheep of Yisrael to the path of obedience. But instead, His identity was hijacked, His words twisted, and His commands buried under centuries of replacement theology.</p>

  <p>Today's churches preach comfort over covenant, emotion over obedience, and prosperity over prophecy. Most Christians have never questioned why their faith looks nothing like the early disciples - because deception is strongest when it feels familiar. The modern “church” has become the <strong>image of the Beast</strong>, mirroring a world-friendly system rather than the Kingdom of Yahuah.</p>

  <p>But prophecy is unfolding. The time has come for the <strong>remnant to awaken</strong>. Yahuah is calling His chosen ones to <strong>come out of her</strong> — to leave behind false names, false holidays, false doctrines, and false worship. This is not about religion - this is about <strong>truth</strong>.</p>

  <p>You were created to know the true Name of your Creator. You were chosen to keep His covenant, honor His Sabbaths, and walk in His ways. And you were warned that deception would be global at the end - but so would the call to return.</p>
